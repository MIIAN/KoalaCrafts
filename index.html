    <h1>Koala Crafts</h1>
    <p>You did it.</p>
    <!--  Think of your website as a program.  Computer programs read top to bottom left to right just like you.

          The html file is the first page of the program.
        
          Each line of code has a tag before and after.
          this green section has a comment tag <! --.  it allows me to make comments in the back end that won't show up on the website.
          To test it out lets close this tag and create a <p> tag or paragraph tag.    
    -->
    <p>Lets build Koala Crafts Landing Page.</p>
